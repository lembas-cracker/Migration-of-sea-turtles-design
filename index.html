      <h1> Learn about sea turtles'<br> long journeys through the ocean!
      </h1>
      <p>Sea turtles are generally solitary creatures that remain submerged for much of the time they are at sea, which makes them extremely difficult to study. They rarely interact with one another outside of courtship and mating.
      Because of the difficulty in studying marine turtles in the open ocean, there are a great many things still unknown about their behavior. Decades of research, however, have produced useful insights into daily activities and behaviors!</p>

      <p>Sea turtles are known to feed and<br>rest off and on during a typical day. <br>During nesting season, research<br> conducted in the southeast United States helped discovered that loggerheads follow regular patterns between<br> the nesting beach itself and offshore reefs and other rocky structures.<br> It is presumed that mating and/or<br> feeding occurs at these offshore areas.</p>

        <h1> Migration<br>Abilities</h1>
        <p>
         The ability of a sea turtle to migrate hundreds and thousands
         of miles from its feeding ground to its nesting beach is
         one of the most remarkable acts in the animal kingdom.
         That adult females return faithfully to nest on the very
         beach where they were born makes the feat even more amazing.
         Research into where and how sea turtles migrate has been
         a focus of scientists for decades. The information collected
         is vital to the development of conservation strategies for the species.
         We now know that sea turtles undergo migration throughout
         their lives, beginning with the first frenzied swim as a hatchling.
